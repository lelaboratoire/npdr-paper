In 100 replicate simulations, correlation, $r$, between the two methods ranges from 0.9827 to 0.9994. STIR is based on a t-test of projected distances and NPDR is based on a logistic regression of projected distances. NPDR has the added benefit of handling continuous outcomes and covariate correction.}}{2}}
