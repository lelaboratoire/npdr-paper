Results for one replicate simulation ($m = 200$ samples and $p = 1,000$ attributes with 100 functional). For continuous outcome (A), importance scores computed by random forest permutation (percent increase in MSE) and NPDR standardized linear regression coefficient. For case-control outcome (C), scores computed by random forest permutation (mean decrease in accuracy) and NPDR standardized logistic regression coefficient. A regression line between the scores with $R^2$ is shown, and a 0.05 Bonferroni cutoff (dashed) is shown for NPDR (A and C). There is no statistical threshold for random forest, so area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC) is used to compare algorithm performance (B, D).}}{5}}
