	Abstract = {Genetic variants in CACNA1C (calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C) are associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia where sleep disturbances are common. In an experimental model, Cacna1c has been found to modulate the electrophysiological architecture of sleep. There are strong genetic influences for consolidation of sleep in infancy, but only a few studies have thus far researched the genetic factors underlying the process. We hypothesized that genetic variants in CACNA1C affect the regulation of sleep in early development. Seven variants that were earlier associated (genome-wide significantly) with psychiatric disorders at CACNA1C were selected for analyses. The study sample consists of 1086 infants (520 girls and 566 boys) from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort (genotyped by Illumina Infinium PsychArray BeadChip). Sleep length, latency, and nightly awakenings were reported by the parents of the infants with a home-delivered questionnaire at 8 months of age. The genetic influence of CACNA1C variants on sleep in infants was examined by using PLINK software. Three of the examined CACNA1C variants, rs4765913, rs4765914, and rs2239063, were associated with sleep latency (permuted P<0.05). There was no significant association between studied variants and night awakenings or sleep duration. CACNA1C variants for psychiatric disorders were found to be associated with long sleep latency among 8-month-old infants. It remains to be clarified whether the findings refer to defective regulation of sleep, or to distractibility of sleep under external influences.},

@article{franke2010,
	Abstract = {Background
Genetic variation in CACNA1C has been repeatedly shown to increase risk for psychiatric disorders, with the strongest evidence for involvement in bipolar disorder. To elucidate the mechanisms by which such effects on psychiatric disease are brought about by genetic factors, we investigated the influence of CACNA1C polymorphisms on brain structure.
Methods
In 585 healthy volunteers, for whom magnetic resonance imaging data at 1.5 T (n = 282) or 3 T (n = 304) were available, we tested 193 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near CACNA1C for association with FSL FIRST--segmented subcortical brain structures and hippocampus as well as SPM5-derived total brain volume and global gray and white matter volume using PLINK.
Results
A study-wide significant association of SNPs in intron 3 of the CACNA1C gene was found for brainstem volume (lowest p value = 3.62E-05) and was confirmed by voxel-based morphometry. An effect on gray matter volume of the bipolar disorder--associated SNP rs1006737, as reported earlier in a sample of 77 healthy adults, could not be confirmed.
Conclusions
Genetic variation in the pleiotropic psychiatric disease gene CACNA1C is associated with brainstem volume. Modulation of this structure, with its central control over motor, cognitive, affective, and arousal functions, constitutes an interesting novel potential mode of action of psychiatric risk factors.},

@article{shimada2010,
	Abstract = {Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and a pathological manifestation of rapid eye movement during sleep. Narcoleptic pathogenesis is triggered by both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, development of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has identified new genetic factors, with many more susceptibility genes yet to be elucidated. Using a new approach that consists of a combination of GWAS and an extensive database search for candidate genes, we picked up 202 candidate genes and performed a replication study in 222 narcoleptic patients and 380 controls. Statistical analysis indicated that six genes, NFATC2, SCP2, CACNA1C, TCRA, POLE, and FAM3D, were associated with narcolepsy (P < 0.001). Some of these associations were further supported by gene expression analyses and an association study in essential hypersomnia (EHS), CNS hypersonia similar to narcolepsy. This novel approach will be applicable to other GWAS in the search of disease-related susceptibility genes.},

@article{psqi,
	Abstract = {Despite the prevalence of sleep complaints among psychiatric patients, few questionnaires have been specifically designed to measure sleep quality in clinical populations. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven ``component'' scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period with ``good'' sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and ``poor'' sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global PSQI score > 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p â©½ 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinemetric and clinical properties of the PSQI suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.},
